# GPU Tutorial

This tutorial uses CUDA and TBB to demonstrate how to use GPUs and what it means to use a GPU.

## Compiling

You must start by installing cmake and conan.

- cmake can be installed from cmake.org
- conan can be installed from pip or wherever you get your python packages

Once installed make a directory called build.
In this directory run `conan install ..` and then `conan build ..`.
At this point you will have compiled the binaries and be able to run them
in the corresponding directories.
